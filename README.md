# WeatherApp

**Note: Use master branch for my code**

For the weather app, we have two pages, as per our requirement.
Landing Page: It will show the current location details as per latitude and longitude.
Next Page: The user is able to get weather details as per city name.

- As per the requirements fulfilled in this application. We have used MVP architecture here for implementing the weather app:

Structural Design Pattern
Model: It contains our application model.
Presenter: It will contain business logic for the application.
Controller: It is the mediator between the model and the presenter.

Unit Testing
For the unit testing, we have used the XCTest framework. Also, write the test assessments for both presenter classes.

for UI
I have used a storyboard for implementing the application.

Linter-enabled project
Sorry to inform you, I'm not able to implement this because my machine is not supported to install SwiftLint.
